# Wallpapers

These are all the wallpapers I have collected.

I try to keep this repo up to date.

## Notes

This repository is _kinda_ big at around >1.53 GBs (checked on April 28, 2024), therefore I recommend you browse to find only the wallpapers you like instead of downloading everything at once.

If you clone this repo with bad WiFi, start praying to God.

## Installation

If you have `git` installed, just run this command to clone this repo to your pictures directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers.git ~/Pictures
```

Alternatively, you can [download this repository as a `.zip` file](https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and then extract it.

### Credits

A huge majority of the wallpapers here I got from the [r/unixporn Discord server](https://discord.gg/unixporn)
